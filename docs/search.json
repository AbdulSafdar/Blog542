It is important to learn because it can be applied to your future job because learning data structures and algorithms could be the difference between your code taking one minute to run versus it taking thirty minutes to run according to this blog. This video is an excellent place to learn the basics and you can practice on LeetCode."

Websites like Kaggle often have practice data sets to work on and machine learning competitions. A solid understanding in these topics can also open up the door for machine learning engineering positions according to this Coursera article."

    "text": "Data Visualization in Python\nSince you likely already have experience using Power BI or Tableau, it is worth learning a new data visualization library for Python. Some of the common libraries in Python include Altair, Seaborn and Plotly. The one you practice on does not really matter because a lot of the syntax for different libraries can be easily learned once you have the basics down. The following scatterplot was created in Altair, just to show you an example of what can be done, if the code does not make sense right now that is ok.\n\n\n\nA cool data visualization of a scatter plot that I can create in Altair."
